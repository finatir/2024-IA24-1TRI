       <p>My Personal Review: <br>
        'Solar Power' by Lorde its probably one of my favorites albums of all time. It contains a unique and different sounding, with addicting melodies and powerful lyrics. Jack Antonoff's production its certainly one of the most important things on the album. Songs like 'Oceanic Feeling', 'The Man With The Axe' and 'Leader Of A New Regime' wouldnt be the same without his production. One of my favorite moments on the album its in the song 'Fallen Fruit', where she makes a fast transition between genres in one song, bringing back a genre who was worked on her second album 'Melodrama'. My favorite songs on the album changes every time. But at this moment they are: 'The Path', 'Stoned At The Nail Salon', 'Secrets From A Girl (Whos Seen It All)', 'The Man With The Axe', 'Oceanic Feeling' and 'Hold No Grudge'.
